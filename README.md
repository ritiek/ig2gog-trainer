# ig2gog-trainer

This is a trainer for the GOG remake of the classic old-school game - [Imperium Galactica II](https://www.gog.com/game/imperium_galactica_ii_alliances). So far, I've only tested the game patch v2.2.0.8 on Windows. v2.2.0.8 is the latest version of the remake released by GOG as of writing this.

There haven't been any new version releases of the game since 2017 and if I were to guess - most likely there won't be a new version release in the future either. Also note, this trainer may or may not work with the older versions, or the demo and full version of the original game released in 1999.
